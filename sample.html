    <h1> Intro to Programming Nanodegree </h1>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll be using HyperText Markup Language to create web pages.
Two necessary items: a place to save your code (i.e. a text editor), and a web browser to view the html files.</p>

<h2>Building your first Webpage</h2>
<p>In order to save your code as a html file and your browser to be able to interpret the html you must save your file with the appropriate extension of .html
That&#8217;s one of the main reasons we use a text editor rather than a word processor it allows us to save our code with the proper extensions.</p>

<p>In order to view the rendered webpage in a web browser such as Firefox, Safari or Chrome you must do the <b>following</b>:</p>

<p>In Mac use Finder to reach the file location. Once you find the file you want to use double-click it and it should open in a web browser.</p>

<p>In Safari you can also use File- Open File and select the desired location to open your html code.</p>

<p>To make changes to the code you must first edit within your text editor and then save and refresh your browser.</p>

<h2>Thinking like a Programmer</h2>
<p><em>A large goal of this programming nano degree is to have you thinking like a programmer.</em></p>

<p><b>Five</b> specific ways of programming that all programmers have to use all the time:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Procedural Thinking</b> - involves creating clear and perfectly unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Abstract Thinking</b> - finding generality amongst seemingly different things. Abstraction helps programmers avoid unnecessary repetition of work.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Systems Thinking</b>- Breaking a big problem down to smaller pieces.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Technological Empathy</b> - Understanding what a computer is how it works and what itâ€™s good and bad at doing.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Debugging</b>- process of identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn&#8217;t work.</p></li>

</ul>


<h2>Learning Mindset</h2>

<p>Students who are committed to endure, be punctual with their coursework and are constantly looking things up are most likely to succeed.</p>

<h1>The World Wide Web</h1>

<p>One perk of using the <b>Atom</b> text editor is being able to preview HTML code using the <em>atom-html-preview</em> package.</p>

<h2>The basics of the Web</h2>

<p>HTML is HyperText Markup Language</p>

<p> The web is comprised of hyperlinks.</p>

<p>The web was invented in the 1990s there are an estimated 30 billion pages </p>


<h2>Types of files that can be found on the Web:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Plain text</li>

<li>HTML</li>

<li>Images</li>

<li>Videos</li>

<li>Music</li>

</ul>


<h2>Components of the Web</h2>

<p>The major pieces are <em>you</em>, <em>your computer running a web browser</em>, <em>the internet</em>, and <em>servers</em>.</p>

<p>Your browser makes requests (using a protocol called HTTP) via the Internet to servers. The servers communicate with your browser and display files.
Some examples of browsers include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Internet Explorer</b><p></li>

<li><p><b>Chrome</b></p></li>

<li><p><b>Safari</b></p></li>

<li><p><b>Firefox</b></p></li>

</ul>

<p>The servers are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files. The HTTP protocol is a basic protocol that your browser uses to communicate with servers.</p>

<h1>HTML Basics</h1>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<p>HTML is made up of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>text content</b>- <em>what you see</em></li>
  <li><b>markup</b>- <em>what it look likes</em></li>
  <li><b>references to other documents</b>- <em>i.e images and videos</em></li>
  <li><b>links to other pages</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to HTML Tags</h2>

<b>Example:</b>

<p><b>&lt;name&gt;</b><em>content</em><b>&lt;/name&gt;</b></p>

<p><b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is the opening tag.</p>

<p><b>&lt;/name&gt;</b> is the closing tag.</p>

<p><b>&lt;name&gt;</b><em>content</em><b>&lt;/name&gt;</b>- <em>this entire section is the element</em></p>

<h2>Bold Tags</h2>

<p><b>&lt;b&gt;</b><em>content</em><b>&lt;/b&gt;</b></p>

<h2>Italics</h2>

<p><b>&lt;em&gt;</b><em>content</em><b>&lt;/em&gt;</b></p>

<h2>Computers are Stupid</h2>

<p>In spoken languages we can craft sentences with a great deal of ambiguity. Programming Languages are designed to limit ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Missing End Tag</h2>

When you forget to close an <b>&lt;em&gt;</b><em>content</em><b>&lt;/em&gt;</b> everything after <b>&lt;em&gt;</b> is <em>italicized</em>.

<h2>Making Links</h2>

<p>use the example tag to link urls:</p>

<p>This website is <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> href="https://www.example.com">my favorite<b>&lt;/a&gt;</b></p>
